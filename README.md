# Dialogue tree command block generator
An Amulet Editor operation that creates command blocks according to a dialogue tree file.

## Installing
1. Copy `dialoguetree.py` into your Amulet `plugins/operations/` folder
2. The generator should now show up in the dropdown list of operations in Amulet's 3D editor the next time you open a world.


See the included `bridgevendor.xml` example for details on how to write your own dialogue tree file.
